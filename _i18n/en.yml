    heading: Welcome to my website!
    p1: Here you can find my blog as well as information about me, my research and my publications. Please bear with me as I set up my site &mdash; like Montreal in the summer, we'll be under construction for a while.
    p2: In the sidebar, you can find my About page (for both specialists and non-specialists), my CV page and certain blog themes. The "tags" icon at the bottom of the sidebar gathers all blog topics in a single place.
    p3: Below, you'll find some of my more recent blog posts. These may be of interest to you especially if you work with any of the following&#58; acoustic data, Praat scripting, R scripting and Twitter data.
